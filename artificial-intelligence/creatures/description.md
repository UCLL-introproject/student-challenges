# Creatures

Artificial intelligence in games often consists of the programmers implementing their own insights into the game as rules for the computer player to follow:

* "If your health is low, prioritize finding a health pack."
* "Build these buildings in this order."
* "A queen is worth three times a knight."
* ...

Creating a smart, challenging AI is generally hard, which is why creating harder difficulties in games is often achieved using relatively simple tricks:

* Give the enemies more health, make it faster, ...
* Add more enemies and give the player less resources.
* Give the AI superhuman abilities such as perfect aim and perfect reflexes.
* Just let the AI cheat altogether.

One of the first games that used "real" artificial intelligence in the form of an artificial neural network (a simulated brain) was Creatures (1996).
What made this feasible was the fact that the AI did not have to play as an opponent against the human player.
Instead, the game took place in a virtual world inhabited by AI-creatures, which could be taught to speak and interact with the world.
This way, it was okay to present the player with an initially "stupid AI", as long as it had the *potential* to be trained to become smarter, but this was the player's job.
