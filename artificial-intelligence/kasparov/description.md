# Kasparov

1997 was the year where the machine was able to surpass mankind at chess.

IBM had created a supercomputer specialized in chess.
In 1996, Garry Kasparov, the world champion at the time, agreed to play a six-game match against this machine.
Kasparov won (three wins, two draws, one loss).

In 1997, IBM got a rematch.
Kasparov won the first game.
In the second game, however, the machine made a strange move, one that bewildered Kasparov.
Up until that point, Kasparov was able to see through the machine's moves, understand its thought process as it were, but this move he could not figure out.
Kasparov was convinced that IBM had brought in a chess grandmaster: he resigned and stormed off.
The following games all ended up in a draw, and the last game was won again by the machine.

This was the first time Kasparov had ever lost a match.
After his defeat, a frustrated Kasparov accused IBM of cheating, but IBM denied any wrongdoing.
Kasparov demanded a rematch, but IBM had already dismantled the machine.

Ultimately, it turned out that the machine's software contained a bug: the mysterious move was actually just randomly picked.
So, one could say that the machine got lucky: its random move left Kasparov flustered, causing him to lose the subsequent games.
These days, however, the machine does not require such luck to win: it can consistently beat the best human players.
