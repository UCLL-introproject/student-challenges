# YAML

YAML is another popular data format.
It is very much like JSON, but with a lighter syntax.

```yaml
- rNumber: r0000001
  firstName: John
  lastName: Doe
- rNumber: r0000002
  firstName: Jane
  lastName: Doe
- rNumber: r0000003
  firstName: John
  lastName: Deere
```

Contrary to JSON, layout is important in YAML.
For example, adding extra spaces in front of `firstName` would lead to an error.
