# Gmail

When picking a Gmail address, many people choose to use `<first-name>.<last-name>@gmail.com`, such as `joe.fox@gmail.com`.
However, the dots don't matter: emails sent to `joefox@gmail.com` or `j.o.e.f.o.x@gmail.com` will arrive in the same inbox.

More interestingly, you can also add tags: `joe.fox+github@gmail.com` and `joe.fox+shopping@gmail.com` are actually the same as `joe.fox@gmail.com`.
These tags can be useful especially when combined with filtering rules.

The provided file `emails.txt` contains a list of emails, one per line.
Count how many unique addresses there really are.
For example, `joe.fox@gmail.com` and `joefox@gmail.com` count as a single unique address.

Note: other email providers may or may not offer the same functionality.
