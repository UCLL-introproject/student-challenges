# Cobol

Cobol (COmmon Business-Oriented Language) was designed in 1959 and is one of the oldest programming languages in existence.
Despite its age, it's still widely used, most notably in the banking sector.
Admittedly, this is not because Cobol such a great language, but mostly because many critical systems
were developed in Cobol decades ago, and it's just too risky to try to rewrite it in a more modern language.

One of Cobol's design goals was to be human readable, which led to a certain level of verbosity Cobol is (in)famous for.
For example, adding `A` to `B` and storing it in `C` was written

```cobol
ADD A TO B GIVING C
```

Luckily, other programming languages have settled for more succinct syntax, such as `C = A + B`.

## Question

Who is considered the lead designer of the Cobol programming language?
