# At Least Five

On [regex101](https://regex101.com/), use `/./` as the regex (don't include the `/`s!).
Enter a random input string.
You'll see that each individual character gets highlighted.

The `.` has special meaning: it means 'match any character'.

Write a regex that checks if a string contains at least 5 characters.
Note that they need not be the same character: `12345` is as valid as `xxxxx`.
