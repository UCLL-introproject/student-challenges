# Security Basics

## Prerequisites

One of the platforms offering free and interactive security challenges is "Try Hack Me" (but others exist too, like Hack The Box).
Create a free account on the [www.tryhackme.com](https://www.tryhackme.com) platform.

In some of the challenges you will learn some basic cyber security skills including ethical hacking.
It is crucial to understand (and therefor necessary) that you need to follow a code of conduct and respect any laws and regulations applicable.
If you are not sure if it is legal and without consequences, *do not proceed*!

If you do stumble upon confidential information or a vulnerability for an organization, read their "responsible disclosure" section and contact the organization immediately with your findings.
For organizations in Belgium, you can read the following [page](https://ccb.belgium.be/nl/bekendmaking-van-kwetsbaarheden-aan-het-ccb).

Rules:

* **Respect Privacy**: Always respect individuals' privacy and personal data, ensuring they remain confidential and protected.
* **Seek Permission**: Obtain explicit permission before testing systems, networks, or applications, respecting the boundaries of authorized targets.
* **Stay Within Scope**: Limit activities to the scope defined by agreements or legal permissions, avoiding any unauthorized access.
* **Report Vulnerabilities**: Promptly disclose identified vulnerabilities to relevant stakeholders, supporting efforts to secure systems.
* **Share Knowledge**: Contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing insights, discoveries, and methods to improve overall security.
* **Do No Harm**: Avoid causing damage, disruption, or loss while conducting security assessments.
* **Continuous Learning**: Commit to ongoing learning and professional development to stay current in evolving technologies and threats.
* **Transparent Communication**: Maintain clear and open communication with clients, collaborators, and affected parties.
* **Lawful Behavior**: Adhere to all laws and regulations governing cybersecurity activities, respecting ethical and legal boundaries.
* **Accountability**: Take responsibility for actions, continuously refining ethical practices to advance cybersecurity without compromising integrity."

Throughout this series of challenges we will introduce you to the field of cyber security.
In order to understand the field of cyber security, you need to be familiar with some basic concepts.
These concepts will be built upon or explored even more in other courses during your bachelor's program.
Make sure you understand them well and success is in your hands!
