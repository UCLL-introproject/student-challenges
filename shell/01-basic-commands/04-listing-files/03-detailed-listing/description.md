# Long Listing Format

In the previous challenges, listing the contents of the current directory only showed the files and directories' names.
However, the OS keeps track of a lot more information than just the name, for example:

* The size.
* The owner of the file.
* Who was permission.
* Last access date and time.

Which shell command can I use to view all this information.
For example, the output would look like this:

```text
total 6
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197610 170 Aug 22 20:49 description.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197610   5 Aug 22 20:50 solution.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner 197610 171 Aug 22 20:50 verify.py
```
