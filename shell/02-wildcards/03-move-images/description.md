# Moving Images

My home folder contains a long list of files: images, music, documents, ...
I want to move all images to a subdirectory named `images`.

* Images have the extension `png` or `jpg`.
* The `images` subdirectory already exists, no need to create it.

How do I achieve this using a single shell command?
