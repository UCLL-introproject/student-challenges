# Command Palette

All keyboard shortcuts are bound to *commands*, each of which has a descriptive name, such as "Copy Line Down", "Toggle Line Comment", etc.
You can view a list of all available commands in the command palette and can easily search for a command by typing in keywords.

What is the keyboard shortcut to show the command palette?
