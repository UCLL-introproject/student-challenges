# Alternatives

VSCode is an excellent choice in many cases, but as an IT person, it is also important not to get overly attached to a single tool.
For larger projects, it can be useful to look into IDEs (Integrated Development Environments); these tend to specialize in a specific technology and are able to provide more tailored experience.
They are generally also much more resource heavy than VSCode.
For example, JetBrains is known for its excellent IDEs:

| Language | IDE |

| Python                | [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) |
| Java                  | [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) |
| C#/.NET               | [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) |
| C/C++                 | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) |
| Go                    | [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) |
| Rust                  | [Rust](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) |

While their products are not free, as a student, you can download them for free.
